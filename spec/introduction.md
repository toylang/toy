# Introduction

Fast is a simple, modern, native, object-oriented, type-safe and single-thread programming language.

## Hello World

The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in Fast (similar to c#):

```fast
using System;

class Hello
{
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
    }
}
```
